The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|------|------|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2) |

**[Weather Observation Station 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5)**

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|------|------|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2) |
| LAT_N |  NUMBER |
| LONG_W | NUMBER |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

*Sample Input*

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

*Sample Output*
```
ABC 3 

PQRS 4
```
*Explanation*

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3,3,4,3,3,4, and 33. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 33 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city), city
LIMIT 1;

SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city DESC
LIMIT 1;

**ADVANCED SELECTS**

**[Type of Triangle](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem)**

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

**Equilateral**: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.    
**Isosceles**: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.    
**Scalene**: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.    
**Not A Triangle**: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.    

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

| Column | Type |
|------|------|
| A | *Integer* |
| B | *Integer* | 
| C | *Integer* |

Each Row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

| A | B | C | 
|----|----|----|
| 20 | 20 | 23 | 
| 20 | 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 21 | 22 | 
|13 | 14 | 30 |

Sample Output
```
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
```

Explanation 

Values in the tuple (20, 20, 23) form an Isocsceles triangle, because A = B.    
Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A = B = C. Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A â‰  B â‰  C.    
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A + B <= C THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR C = A THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN A <> B  AND B <> C AND C <> A THEN 'Scalene'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```
**[The PADS](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem)**

Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in **OCCUPATIONS**, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).    
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in **OCCUPATIONS**. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of (occupation_count) (occupations)s.    
Where (occupation_count) is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and (occupation) is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same (occupation_count), they should be ordered alphabetically.    
**Note:** There will be at least two entries in the tables for each type of occupation.

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as folows: 
| Column | Type | 
|-----|-----|
| Name | *String* | 
| Occupation | *String* | 
Occupation will only contain one of the following values: **Doctor**, **Professor**, **Singer**, or **Actor**. 

Sample Input

An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records: 

| Name | Occupation | 
|-----|-----|
| Samantha | Doctor | 
| Julia | Actor | 
| Maria | Actor | 
| Meera | Singer | 
| Ashely | Professor | 
| Ketty | Professor | 
| Christeen | Professor |
| Jane | Actor | 
| Jenny | Doctor | 
| Priya | Singer | 

Sample Output

```
Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.
```

Explanation    
The results of the first query are formatted to the problem description's specifications.    
The results of the second query are ascendingly ordered first by number of names corresponding to each profession (2 â‰¤ 2 â‰¤ 3 â‰¤ 3), and then alphabetically by profession (doctor â‰¤ singer, and actor â‰¤ professor ).

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(NAME, '(', SUBSTR(OCCUPATION,1,1), ')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME;

SELECT  CONCAT("There are a total of ", COUNT(OCCUPATION), ' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION) ASC, OCCUPATION;
```
