**[Weather Observation Station 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5)**

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|------|------|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2) |

*Sample Input*

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

*Sample Output*

ABC 3 

PQRS 4

*Explanation*

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3,3,4,3,3,4, and 33. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 33 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city), city
LIMIT 1;

SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city DESC
LIMIT 1;

**[Higher Than 75 marks](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/more-than-75-marks/problem)**

Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

Input Format

The STUDENTS table is described as follows:

|  Column | Type |
|---|---|
| ID  | INTEGER |
| NAME | STRING |
| MARKS  | INTEGER |


The Name column only contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.

Sample Input

|  ID | NAME | MARKS |
|---|---|----|
| 1  | ASHLEY | 81 |

Sample Output

Ashley
Julia
Belvet

Explanation

Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > 75. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT NAME
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE MARKS > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME,3) ASC, ID  
```
